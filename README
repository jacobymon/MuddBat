+++ Instructions for running Flask and this small application +++

In your shell/command-line/terminal (not working! ask us!! :-)


+++ [1] Install Flask using your preferred Python's pip or pip3 installer.
    You may need to include a path to pip, e.g., /path-to-pip/pip install flask :

    /path-to-pip/pip install flask

Notes:

  If you're using an anaconda version of Python, you already have flask.

  Since there is an image-inverting example, you may also have to run
    /path-to-pip/pip install Pillow

  Optionally -- you can first create a venv (virtual environmnt) as described on the Flask install website: 
  flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/


+++ [2] Be sure you know where the week2 files are for this class...

Still at your shell/command-line/terminal:

    cd within our week 2's files ... to FlaskAppStarter


+++ [3] Set environment variables, different for Mac vs Windows:

[Mac] If you're on a MAC/Linux, run these two commands at the terminal:
    export FLASK_APP=example-app.py   
    export FLASK_ENV=development   
    
[Win] If you're on a Windows machine, run these two commands at the command-line:    
    set FLASK_APP=example-app.py   
    set FLASK_ENV=development    

If the above commands work, you won't see any response.


+++ [4] Run Flask:

Still at the command-line, run

    python -m flask run

(be sure you're in the FlaskAppStarter folder)
If it works, you should see a number of messages, and then


+++ [5] Find your Flask Application from your browser:

Paste this url into a new tab of your browser:        

    http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 


Let me&us know if there are troubles!

(If Flask simply refuses to work, our fall-back is to write substitute in Python and check it there... 
 However, that's not as fun -- and not as "full-stack!")
